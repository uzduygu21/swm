                  The foundation of Servet Wealth Management began over a decade
                  ago when I started at Merrill Lynch building my business with
                  a dedication to helping clients meet their financial goals.
                  While working with clients, I pursued the education needed to
                  earn my CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER, or CFP®, certification so
                  I can assist clients with increasingly complex financial
                  planning scenarios. I am most passionate about finding
                  solutions and options for the real-world challenges and
                  opportunities for my clients as they make their way along the
                  path of their financial journey. When I am able to present
                  clients with solutions they feel confident in implementing, I
                  know that I have stayed true to the mission of my business to
                  serve them.

                I’ve always had a love of the outdoors and I grew up camping and
                hiking in many of our National Parks; some of my fondest
                memories are of camping in the beautiful Yosemite Valley. My
                wife and I share that love of exploration and new experiences
                and today we travel to new cities, enjoy renting bikes, pedaling
                around the city looking for those hidden gems, under-the-radar
                restaurants that so often reflect the culture and diversity of
                an area.

                I find immense joy in exploring the world around me, be it
                through the pages of a book, the laughter shared with family and
                friends, or travel. Reading is a passion that fuels my
                imagination and enriches my soul. Books have a unique power to
                transport me to new realms, challenge my perspectives, and
                inspire personal growth. Beyond my love for books, I cherish
                taking my son to explore new places and embarking on thrilling
                escapades to create unforgettable memories together.
